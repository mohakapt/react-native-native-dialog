<h2 id='section_motivation'>
🚀 Motivation
</h2>

The issue with trying to mock native components using `<View />`s is that no matter how much time and effort you spend to make it look like the real-deal, You end up with janky looking results (I spent hours taking screenshots of the real Android dialog and trying to imitate it, And didn't get a satisfying result). But to be fair, using `react-native` `<View />`s offers a lot of customization which is something you cannot simply just get with native libraries. So there is a decision that needs to be made.

Anyways I decided to make a library for some of the commonly used dialogs using native APIs.


<h2 id='section_installation'>
⬇️ Installation
</h2>

```bash
npm install react-native-native-dialog --save

cd ios && pod install   # Only if you're building for iOS
```
**Or if you're using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add react-native-native-dialog

cd ios && pod install   # Only if you're building for iOS
```

> ⚠️ The library only works with react-native@0.60 and up.

⚒️ Additional Setup
</h2>

Since this library only works with react-native@0.60.0 and up there is no need to manually link the library, But there still some additional setup you need to do.

**iOS**

This library is written in `Swift` so we need to create a bridging header in your `XCode` project (If you've already done it you can skip this section).

![Create Bridging Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohakapt/react-native-native-dialog/master/images/create-bridging-header.gif)

0. First of all make sure you run ```pod install``` in `Terminal` inside `ios` folder.
0. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `[your project's name]` ➜ `New File...`
0. Select `Swift File`, click `Next` and then click `Create`.
0. `XCode` will ask you whether you want to create bridging header, Click `Create Bridging Header`.
0. Build your project (`Cmd+B`), And you're ready to go.

**Android**

Unfortunately `Android` doesn't support changing the `accentColor` dynamically, the only way to use a custom `accentColor` is to define your style statically in `res/values/styles.xml` (If you're ok with using the default `accentColor` ![#009688](https://placehold.it/15/009688/000000?text=+) in `Android` you can skip this section).

0. Open `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`
   - If you don't have one create a new file in the exact same path.
   - Add those tow styles to the bottom of your `styles.xml` file and replace `colorPrimary`, `colorPrimaryDark` and `colorAccent` with your own colors: 
   ```diff
   <resources>
       ...
   
   +    <style name="AlertDialog" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Dialog.Alert">   <!--This theme is used for dark dialog-->
   +        <item name="colorPrimary">#FFB300</item>       <!--Replace the these colors with your own colors-->
   +        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">#FFB300</item>
   +        <item name="colorAccent">#FFB300</item>
   +    </style>
   
   +    <style name="LightAlertDialog" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.Dialog.Alert">   <!--This theme is used for light dialog-->
   +        <item name="colorPrimary">#E6A100</item>       <!--Replace the these colors with your own colors-->
   +        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">#E6A100</item>
   +        <item name="colorAccent">#E6A100</item>
   +    </style>
   
   </resources>
   ```
0. Next open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainAppliction.java`
   - Add `import com.github.mohaka.nativedialog.RNNativeDialogPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
   - Add `RNNativeDialogPackage.setDialogTheme(R.style.AlertDialog, R.style.LightAlertDialog);` to the bottom of `onCreate()` method.
   ```diff
   ... 
   
   import android.app.Application;
   import android.content.Context;
   
   + import com.github.mohaka.nativedialog.RNNativeDialogPackage;
   
   ...
   
   @Override
   public void onCreate() {
       super.onCreate();
       SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false);
   +   RNNativeDialogPackage.setDialogTheme(R.style.AlertDialog, R.style.LightAlertDialog);
       initializeFlipper(this, getReactNativeHost().getReactInstanceManager());
   }
   
   ...
   ```
0. Build your project and start using `react-native-native-dialog`.
